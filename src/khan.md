# CON

CON is the universal set of constraints. In OT, every language makes use of the the same constraint sets, but with different [rankings](rankings.md) as the locus of linguistic variation. In terms of Universal Grammar, this means that the constraints themselves are part of UG, but the language-specific rankings are learned.
