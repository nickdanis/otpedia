# Overview

Optimality Theory is a constraint-based, parallel grammatical framework. This contrasts with the rule-based serialism of [SPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_Pattern_of_English). The architecture of OT consists of three primary components: GEN, CON, and EVAL.

The version of OT we define is strict-domination OT, sometimes called classical OT.
