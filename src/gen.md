# GEN

GEN takes a given [input](candidates.md#input) and **generates** a set of possible output forms. Each input/output pair, along with the correspondence relation between them, is a [candidate](candidates.md).

GEN is a function and it must be defined explicitly. GEN can be thought of as applying any number of possible phonological operations to an input form: adding segments, removing segments, changing segments, and so on.
